This repo contains the official implementation for the paper Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network for Time Series Forecasting.

How to Run the Code

1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch 1.9.0.
2. Download data. You can obtain all the benchmarks from Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bG5kOK_CWWXyF6N6vAlfFzkXjmK7lanL). All the datasets are well pre-processed and can be used easily.
3. Train the model. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder ./scripts. Now you can reproduce the experiment results by:

   sh ETTh1.sh
